# Variable-Passive-Band-Pass-Filter
The circuit represents a variable passive BPF.
A bandpass filter (BPF) is a circuit that enables frequencies within a certain frequency range to pass through while rejecting (attenuating) frequencies outside that range. A bandpass filter is a combination between a low pass filter and a high pass filter.
The filter is considered to be a passive filter (not active); which means it receives information (or frequencies) then filter them to get the required frequencies.
The filter is also a variable one. The main idea here is that when we change the resistance value, the bandwidth changes.
